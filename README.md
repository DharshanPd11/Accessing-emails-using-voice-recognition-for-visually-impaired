# Accessing-emails-using-voice-recognition-for-visually-impaired
 
 Brief :
    * The model was developed to help blind people access emails by making it easy to send mails through Speech Recognition-API and
      also they can make the machine read their inbox mails thorugh Text-to-Speech API.
    * Firstly, it was developed as a mini-project under my degree curriculam which eventually took over 
      3 months of hardwork of me and my team-mates.
    * We researched a lot for this project as we were freshers with no experience while building this model. 
    * This is a bonafide work done by the students- Priyadharshan.R, Sridaran.U.S, Selvakumar.R of the department
      Computer Science and Engineering at Velammal Engineering College under Anna University, Chennai
